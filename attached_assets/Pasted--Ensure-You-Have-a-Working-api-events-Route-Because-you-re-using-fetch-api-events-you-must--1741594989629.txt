. Ensure You Have a Working /api/events Route
Because you’re using fetch("/api/events?…"), you must expose an endpoint at /api/events that returns JSON in the shape:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "name": "Event Title",
    "date": "2023-01-01T10:00:00Z",
    "venue": "Venue Name",
    "location": "City, State",
    "price": "Free",
    "category": "Music",
    "url": "https://example.com/event",
    "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
  },
  ...
]
If you do not already have such a route, you’ll need to create one. Examples:

<details> <summary>**If you're using Express on Replit**</summary>
ts
Copy
Edit
import express from "express";

const app = express();

app.get("/api/events", (req, res) => {
  // In practice, you'd parse req.query.city, req.query.from, and req.query.to
  // and return data filtered by those parameters. For now, you can respond with mock data.
  const events = [
    {
      id: "1",
      name: "Mock Event",
      date: new Date().toISOString(),
      venue: "Test Venue",
      location: "Test City",
      price: "Free",
      category: "Music",
      url: "https://example.com/event/1",
      image: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    },
  ];
  return res.json(events);
});

// start listening
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server listening on port 3000");
});
</details> <details> <summary>**If you're using Next.js (pages/api style)**</summary>
ts
Copy
Edit
// pages/api/events.ts
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

export default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const { city, from, to } = req.query;
  // Return events filtered by city, from, to, etc.
  const events = [
    {
      id: "1",
      name: "Mock Event",
      date: new Date().toISOString(),
      venue: "Test Venue",
      location: "Test City",
      price: "Free",
      category: "Music",
      url: "https://example.com/event/1",
      image: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    },
  ];
  res.status(200).json(events);
}
</details> <details> <summary>**If you're using the new Next.js App Router** (`app/api/events/route.ts`)</summary>
ts
Copy
Edit
// app/api/events/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function GET(req: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(req.url);
  const city = searchParams.get("city");
  const fromDate = searchParams.get("from");
  const toDate = searchParams.get("to");
  
  // Return events filtered by city, fromDate, toDate, etc.
  const events = [
    {
      id: "1",
      name: "Mock Event",
      date: new Date().toISOString(),
      venue: "Test Venue",
      location: "Test City",
      price: "Free",
      category: "Music",
      url: "https://example.com/event/1",
      image: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    },
  ];

  return NextResponse.json(events);
}
</details>
If you do not implement one of these backends, your request to /api/events will 404 or fail.

2. Confirm the Query Parameters Are Expected by Your Backend
The code appends city, from, and to query parameters:

ts
Copy
Edit
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  city: city.trim()
});
if (dateRange?.from) {
  params.append('from', format(dateRange.from, 'yyyy-MM-dd'));
}
if (dateRange?.to) {
  params.append('to', format(dateRange.to, 'yyyy-MM-dd'));
}
Verify your backend code looks for these same parameters: city, from, to. If your backend uses different naming (e.g. start_date), you need to adjust either the frontend or backend so they match.

3. Check Your city Prop
Your query is only enabled when Boolean(city) is true. If city is empty (e.g. "") or undefined, React Query won’t run:

ts
Copy
Edit
enabled: Boolean(city)
Make sure you’re actually passing a non-empty city to EventList.
If you want the request to run even with an empty city, remove the enabled line or change that logic.
4. Verify the Date Handling
You’re using format(dateRange.from, 'yyyy-MM-dd') from date-fns to convert the date to a string. Double-check that you have date-fns installed and imported.
On the backend, confirm you’re also parsing this from and to date format properly.
If your dateRange is sometimes undefined or empty, your backend might reject the request or default to returning nothing. Debug by logging req.query.from and req.query.to (or the equivalent) on your backend to confirm.
Error Handling
In your code, if the response is not ok, you do:

ts
Copy
Edit
const errorData = await response.json();
throw new Error(errorData.details || 'Failed to fetch events');
This means your backend must return JSON for error cases, too. If your backend sends back plain text on error, response.json() will fail. For consistent error handling, return JSON from the backend even when responding with an error, such as:

ts
Copy
Edit
res.status(400).json({ details: "Missing parameters" });
Conclusion
In short:

Stand up a matching /api/events route that returns the JSON structure your frontend expects.
Confirm the query parameters in fetch match your backend’s logic.
Ensure city is defined so the query is enabled.
Confirm date parsing logic and error handling.
With those pieces in place, the UI code you shared should work as intended in Replit or any other environment.
